Flight No. 305 CTF (capture-the-flag) is a multi-level storyline themed jeopardy style CTF challenge based on the story of D.B. Cooper Hijacking. This CTF will take all the participants on a journey of D.B. Cooper Hijacking that real-world attackers may face when compromising and taking hold of target systems. It may also give the competitors an understanding to enable critical thinking and apply necessary attacking techniques in a real case scenario.

## 1.1	Problem Statement

#### This project is based on a real scenario which is D.B. Cooper Flight High jack. For the time being, nowadays, technology has been playing a massive role in the world. As well as technology has been involved in improving transportation. Flight high jacking has been taking place for a while, and cyber-criminal activities also have grown beyond the expected level. This project elaborates on how to improve the airline ticketing systemâ€™s security. The primary purpose is to educate and prepare the airline security team for a system breach and to give some real-world experience.

## 1.2	Product Scope

#### Flight No. 305 project mainly focuses on the airline security team. It has several levels: 1-12 as from basic levels to complex levels.

The primary purpose is to educate and give experience about cyber security and its activities. This project might be suitable for individuals who like to do cyber security as their profession. And mainly from this project, we primarily tried to give an experience and prepare the security team of particular airlines booking systems breaches. The goal is to educate all the airline security individuals and relevant security teams about how breaches can happen and how attackers might try to breach a system. By playing this system, anyone can enjoy and get knowledge about cyber security and real-world experience.

#### As above figure demonstrates, level 1 to level 6 is the introductory level. It focuses on general activities. When it comes to level 7 to level 12, those are mainly designed for security individuals. To complete those tasks, it is needed to install Linux based OS (Kali-Linux is recommended) and some other mentioned tools on the challenge description.

## The Infrastructure of Flight No. 305 - The CTF

#### The infrastructure of Flight No. 305 runs under 02 primary cloud services: Azure (Dashboard) & AWS (NWA System). Contestant requests are only accepted after the DDoS verification process of Cloudflare. Flight No. 305 uses Netlify CDN (Content Delivery Network) server for quick delivery of challenges on some occasions.

#### All the other developments are implemented inside the desired cloud services as follows.
