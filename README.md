# Flight No. 305 - The CTF
Flight No. 305 CTF (capture-the-flag) is a multi-level storyline themed jeopardy style CTF challenge based on the story of D.B. Cooper Hijacking. This CTF will take all the participants on a journey of D.B. Cooper Hijacking that real-world attackers may face when compromising and taking hold of target systems. It may also give the competitors an understanding to enable critical thinking and apply necessary attacking techniques in a real case scenario.
